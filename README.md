# Recipes
Recipes is a web based recipe database system with advanced meassure and energy features.

## Completed Features:

* Ingredients can have density making it possible to convert between weight and volume meassures.
* Ingredients can have energy/100g making all recipes able to calculate energy per serving.
* Adjustable servings for recipes and menus
* Every ingredient can have custom meassures added, for example "rye bread" could have a "slice" meassure which is unique to "rye bread".

## Planned Features:

* Recipes can be combined into a menu, which will give you the total energy / serving for the combined recipes.
